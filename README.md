# database_connection
Start in javaapplication1

run the cuForm.java

cuForm will run the readFirstNames.java which will run the ConnectToDatabase.java  

I can read the data and print it to the console, but I cannot seem to use the data to fill the combobox.
I THINK  I need to make the array public in the readFirstNames.java
